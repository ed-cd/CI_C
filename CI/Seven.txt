Q - You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you
pick one game or the other?

A - 
P(1 shot) = p
P(at least 2 shots) = P(3 shots) + P(2 shots)
= p^3 + p*p*(1-p)*3
= 3*p^2 - 2*p^3
solve for 3*p^2 - 2*p^3 = p
3p^2 - 2p^3 -p = 0
So probabilities are equal when p = 0, 0.5, or 1
Differentiate to get 6p - 6p^2, so slope positive at 0.5
Therefore beofre p = 0.5 game 1 better.

Q - There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the
triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction
being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

A - For any N vertex polygon, each ant can walk clockwise or anti clockwise
therefore they all have to chose 1 direction , P(1 direction) = 0.5^N, therefore total probability of collision  = 1 - 2* 0.5^N
